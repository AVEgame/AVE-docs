Much of the discussion of the development of AVE takes place on IRC.

You can access the IRC channel via Freenode's [web-based IRC client](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=ave-dev) or
in your own IRC client using the following settings:

* Server: `irc.freenode.net`
* Port: `6667` (non-SSL) or `6697` (SSL)
* Channel: `#ave-dev`
