img:l /img/badge.jpg AVE running on the EMF [TiLDA Mk&pi;](https://badge.emfcamp.org/wiki/TiLDA_MK3) badge.
At [Elecromagetic Field (EMF) 2016](https://emfcamp.org), all attendees were given
a [TiLDA Mk&pi;](https://badge.emfcamp.org/wiki/TiLDA_MK3) badge. We have
made a version of AVE that runs on this badge.

You can download the most recent stable version of AVE 
from the app library on your badge, or from [here](http://api.badge.emfcamp.org/app/mscroggs/ave)'.
Alternatively you can build the badge version of AVE by [downloading the source from GitHub](/git),
then building with `./build.py emf`.

You more information about building different version of AVE [here](/docs/build.md).
