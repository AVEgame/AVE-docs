Syntax Highlighting
===================
When writing your own games, syntax highlighting can be very useful.
This page will help you enable syntax highlighting in the text editors for which we have implemented it.

nano
----
If you use nano, the file [`ave.nanorc`](https://github.com/AVEgame/AVE/blob/master/games/ave.nanorc)
will enable syntax highlighting in `.ave` files.

To enable syntax highlighting in nano, first download [`ave.nanorc`](https://github.com/AVEgame/AVE/blob/master/games/ave.nanorc)
then add the following to your `.nanorc` file (located in your home folder; if it doesn't exist, create it):
    include "/path/to/ave.nanorc"
